## Development Environment 

To recreate the development environment, you need the following software and/or libraries with the specified versions:

* Install Pygame (Doesn't work with anything higher than Python 12.1)
* A WIFI connection.


## Useful Websites to Learn More

I found these websites useful in developing this software:

* [Python Sockets Explained](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bwTAVGg_kVs)
* [Python Sockets Guide](https://realpython.com/python-sockets/#echo-client-and-server)
* [Pygame Documentation](https://www.pygame.org/docs)

## Future Work

The following items I plan to fix, improve, and/or add to this project in the future:

* [x] Sometimes the first client that enters bugs out and closes the client. Just open a new client and it should work. 
* [x] Sometimes when player dies, they teleport into walls.
* [x] Explosion sprite never works yet.
